# Hand Gesture-Based Controls for Virtual Object Interaction

This project focuses on implementing hand gesture-based controls for interacting with virtual objects in a 3D environment. Using Python's OpenCV and CVZone libraries, we track hand movements in real-time within PyCharm. The tracked data is then transferred to Unity 3D environment for further processing. Additionally, Visual Studio Code is utilized for writing C# code to integrate hand tracking functionality into Unity.
